Introduction
============

DIAMOND is a sequence aligner for protein and translated DNA searches,
designed for high performance analysis of big sequence data. The key
features are:

-   Pairwise alignment of proteins and translated DNA at 100x-10,000x
    speed of BLAST.
-   Frameshift alignments for long read analysis.
-   Low resource requirements and suitable for running on standard
    desktops or laptops.
-   Various output formats, including BLAST pairwise, tabular and XML,
    as well as taxonomic classification.

About
=====
DIAMOND is currently developed by Benjamin Buchfink at the Drost lab, Max
Planck Institute for Biology, Tübingen, Germany (since 2019).
Its development was supported for one year by the German Federal Ministry
for Economic Affairs and Energy through an EXIST grant in 2018-2019. It was
developed independently by Benjamin Buchfink from 2016-2018. Its initial
version was developed in 2013-2015 by Benjamin Buchfink at the Huson lab, University
of Tübingen, Germany.
